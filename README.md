# Creator Flow — Week 1

Welcome to my first journey into the ZAMA ecosystem!  
This repository is part of my participation in the Creator Flow initiative, highlighting ZAMA's FHE technologies, upcoming demos, and my own experience as a Web3 builder.

## 🔐 Upcoming Test: Confidential Token Portfolio  
Next week, I’ll begin testing the Confidential Token Portfolio — ZAMA’s FHE-powered dApp enabling private token transfers with shielded balances.

In this repo, I plan to document my testing experience:  
- 📥 Claiming faucet tokens  
- 🔄 Executing transactions on the ZAMA testnet  
- 🛡️ Exploring privacy mechanisms like Shield  
- 🖼️ Screenshots and reflections from the process

*Testing is scheduled for July 22–28, 2025 — updates will follow as it unfolds.*

## 🌍 ZAMA Ecosystem Builder Demo  
ZAMA just announced the first in a series of Builder Demos!  
I’m joining the demo next week to learn, connect, and support FHE builders around the world. This repository will also include notes and highlights from the demo sessions.

## 📁 What you’ll find here  
- OBS setup and visuals from my Twitter Live stream  
- Drafts, scripts, and posts related to Creator Flow  
- Web3 resources and links I personally curated
