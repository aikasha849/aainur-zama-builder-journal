## üéôÔ∏è Livestream Narration Text

> ‚ÄúToday I‚Äôll introduce the Zama Builder Demo ‚Äî a space where anyone can explore confidential Web3 using FHE technology.  
>  
> Zama has launched a public testnet that allows users to connect their wallets, receive test tokens through a faucet, and try encrypted operations.  
>  
> This demo environment shows how Full Homomorphic Encryption lets users interact privately on-chain: shield tokens, transfer encrypted assets, and view hidden balances.  
>  
> While I‚Äôm not doing a live demo yet ‚Äî in the next episode, we‚Äôll walk through every step. For now, this is a glimpse into privacy-powered Web3.‚Äù
