## 🌟 Intro — Welcome

Hello everyone! I’m Ainur, and I’m excited to welcome you to my Builder Flow stream as part of the ZAMA Creator Week.  
I’ve been documenting my journey in Web3, exploring new tools, and diving into ZAMA’s ecosystem.  
Today, I’ll walk you through my discoveries and demo a few technologies that shape the future of encrypted computation.

Let’s begin by introducing ZAMA — the organization behind some of the most exciting work in the field of FHE technology.

## 🔐 Section 1 — What is ZAMA?

ZAMA is a company developing privacy-preserving technology based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).  
FHE allows computations directly on encrypted data — a breakthrough that could transform how privacy works across industries.

🧠 Think about it: your data stays encrypted, even while being used by applications — no need to decrypt.

I'll show how ZAMA brings FHE to life, and why it's essential in today's Web3 world.

## 🧪 Section 2 — ZAMA Testnet & Confidential Portfolio

I’ll guide you through the ZAMA Testnet and explain how I interacted with the Confidential Portfolio.  
You’ll see how I used tools, what challenges I faced, and what insights I gained as a builder.

## 💡 Section 3 — Technology Behind FHE

Let’s dive deeper into how FHE works under the hood.  
From mathematical principles to real use cases — we’ll make it understandable, even if you’re new to encryption.

## 🌍 Section 4 — The Energy of Web3

Building in public, sharing your story, and connecting with other creators — Web3 is alive with energy.  
I'll reflect on how this stream, my repo, and the Guild experience helped me evolve as a digital builder.

## 🧬 Section 5 — ZAMA Ecosystem Builder Demos

I’ll also showcase other demos from fellow participants — what inspired me and what I’m exploring next.
