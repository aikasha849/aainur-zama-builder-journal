# OBS Setup — My Live Stream Plan

Here I'll collect ideas and sketches for how my Creator Flow stream will look in OBS.

💡 What I plan to include:
- My camera — bottom corner so I’m visible
- Title bar — showing each topic during the stream
- ZAMA logo — somewhere up top for style
- Background — something light, Web3 style
- Chat window — maybe on the side, if I include audience messages

🛠️ I’ll add screenshots and real setup after testing it out. This is just the starting idea! )))
